Wakufuro(*workflows: Japanese*) is one-stop repo for day-to-day github actions, that I use. Making a single repo with all of them to play around, makes one less thing to worry about.

## Actions 

1. **Sync_S3.yml** - To upload/download files from/to AWS S3. Read more on this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69989260/download-from-s3-into-a-actions-workflow) and [here](https://github.com/keithweaver/aws-s3-github-action)
